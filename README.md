# Permutations of a given letters list with Python
Here is how it works:
* You need to enter the number of letters of which you want to find permutations on
* Based on your previous input, you will be asked to enter the characters
* Then you will be asked to enter the length of permutations that you want to find
* A new list will be created with permutations based on parameters you entered
* Through nltk.corpus we check for all permutations that exists in wordnet and we add them on a new list
* At the end, possible words will be printed
